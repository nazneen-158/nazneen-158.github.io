First Covid-19 case happened in November, China government records show - report
Earliest case detected on 17 November, weeks before authorities acknowledged new virus.<br>

The first case of someone suffering from Covid-19 can be traced back to 17 November, according to
 media reports on unpublished Chinese government data.<br>

The report, in the South China Morning Post, said Chinese authorities had identified at least 266 people
 who contracted the virus last year and who came under medical surveillance, and the earliest case was 17 
November – weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus.

The Chinese government was widely criticised over attempts to cover up the outbreak in the early weeks,
 including crackdowns on doctors who tried to warn colleagues about a new Sars-like virus which was emerging 
in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.
The data obtained by the Post, which the Guardian has not been able to verify, said a 55-year-old from Hubei
 province could have been the first person to contract Covid-19. For about one month after that date there 
were one to five new cases reported each day, the report said, and by 20 December there were 60 confirmed cases.

The virus, which is now a pandemic, has infected at least 128,343 people across the world and killed 4,702.
 Of those who have contracted the virus since it began, 68,324 people have recovered.

Almost 81,000 of the cases occurred in China, mostly in the province of Hubei.<br>

Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed
 case had been diagnosed on 8 December. Doctors who tried to raise the alarm with colleagues about a new disease
 in late December were reprimanded. Authorities did not publicly concede there was human-to-human transmission until 21 January.

Jonathan Mayer, professor emeritus at the University of Washington’s department of epidemiology, said it was “entirely conceivable”
 there were cases as early as mid-November.

He said there were three possibilities: that cases weren’t detected at the time, that they were detected but not recognised 
as a new disease, or they were detected and recognised but reporting was suppressed.

“I have no way of knowing which of these possibilities in fact happened,” Mayer told the Guardian.

<h1>REASON</h1><br><br>
<div>
<p>
The recent outbreak began in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. Reports of the first COVID-19 cases started 
in December 2019.<br>

Coronaviruses are common in certain species of animals, such as cattle and camels. Although the transmission of coronaviruses
 from animals to humans is rare, this new strain likely came from bats, though one study suggests pangolins may be the origin.

However, it remains unclear exactly how the virus first spread to humans.

Some reports trace the earliest cases back to a seafood and animal market in Wuhan. It may have been from here that SARS-CoV-2 
started to spread to humans.
<br>
<h2>How it spreads</h2>
<p style:"float:left;">
SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person through close communities.

When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus. These droplets can enter the 
mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur.

The most common way that this illness spreads is through close contact with someone who has the infection. Close contact is within 
around 6 feet.

The disease is most contagious when a person’s symptoms are at their peak. However it is possible for someone without symptoms to 
spread the virus. A new study suggests that 10% of infections are from people exhibiting no symptoms.

Droplets containing the virus can also land on nearby surfaces or objects. Other people can pick up the virus by touching these
 surfaces or objects. Infection is likely if the person then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth.

It is important to note that COVID-19 is new, and research is still ongoing. There may also be other ways that the new coronavirus can spread.

<h2>Is it more dangerous than other viruses?</h2>
<p>
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious. However, it can cause symptoms that become severe, leading to death in some cases.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been sudden. This makes it difficult to estimate how often the disease becomes
 severe or the exact rate of mortality.

One report suggests that out of 1,099 people with confirmed cases in China, around 16% became severe. Another 
report estimates that about 3.6% of the confirmed cases in China led to death.

These figures are likely to change as the situation evolves. However, they suggest that COVID-19 is more deadly
 than influenza. For example, seasonal influenza typically leads to death in less than 0.1% of cases.

When testing becomes easier and more widespread, health experts will have a more accurate insight into the exact
 number of severe cases and deaths.

SARS is another type of coronavirus. It became a global pandemic in 2002–2003. Around 9.6% of SARS cases led to death.
 However, COVID-19 is more contagious, and it is already the cause of more deaths worldwide.
